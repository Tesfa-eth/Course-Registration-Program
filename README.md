# Course Registration Program

What does this program do?
* It takes inputs from the user about their background information and their class preferences
* Then it chooses and suggests classes based on their preferences and the difficulty of the class it suggests will be determined by the background information the user gives.
* It then allows the user to choose classes from the suggestion and after the selection is over, it shows the schedule of the classes in a grid and will point out classes which clash!

P.S This program is Bennington College specific
